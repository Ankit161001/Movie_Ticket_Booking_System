# Movie_Ticket_Booking_System
Simple Python code to simulate the working of movie ticket booking system using Tkinter.
<br>
<br>
Before running the code be sure to install Tkinter into your system.
To install Tkinter first check if you have python installed in your computer.
Open command prompt and type the command `python --version`.
<br>
<br>
If version does not appears that means your system does not have python installed properly.
Head over to `python.org` and download and install python first.
While installing be sure to check the `Add python to PATH` button.
<br>
<br>
To check the successful installation of python, in cmd type `python --version`. If the version appears, then it is installed.
<br>
<br>
If python is installed then type `pip install tk`, it will install the tkinter package for python onto your computer.
Then in cmd type the command `import tkinter as tk`. If no errors are thrown, then tkinter is successfully installed.
The code should be good to go now.
